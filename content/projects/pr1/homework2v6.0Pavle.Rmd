# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <- weather %>% select(c(Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:13, values_to = "delta",names_to="Month")
tidyweather
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r, facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}
tidyweather_1 <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather_1, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies by Month"
  ) + 
  facet_wrap(~month)

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

density_plot<-ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )
density_plot
```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}

#create yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%     
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#create a plot for the data:
data_plot<-ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+ geom_smooth() + theme_bw() +
  labs ( title = "Average Yearly Anomaly", y= "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         
data_plot

```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
# create 95% CI for the annual delta in temperature from 2011-present for each  
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(delta)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_delta = sd(delta),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_delta = sd(delta)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
            rating_low = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
            rating_high = mean_delta + margin_of_error)
#print out formula_ci
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap,eval=FALSE}
library(infer)

set.seed(1234)

boot_delta <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>%
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "mean")

# create and print bootstrapped CI
percentile_ci <- boot_delta %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = "percentile")
percentile_ci

# visualize bootstrapped CI 
visualize(boot_delta) + 
  shade_ci(endpoints = percentile_ci, fill = "khaki")+
  labs(title='Bootstrapped 95% confidence interval for the annual average delta in temperature',x = "Delta",y = "Gross revenue")+
  theme_bw()


```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

We create a 95% confidence interval for the annual average delta in temperature, with the lower confidence value of 0.917 and the upper confidence value of 1.02. This means that 95% of the annual average delta since 2011 falls into the range of 0.917 and 1.02. This is alarming because it means the temperature is getting hotter, threatning the oceans, atmostphere, and land.  


# General Social Survey (GSS)

The [General Social Survey (GSS)](http://www.gss.norc.org/) gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviours, and attributes. Many trends have been tracked for decades, so one can see the evolution of attitudes, etc in American Society.


In this assignment we analyze data from the **2016 GSS sample data**, using it to estimate values of *population parameters* of interest about US adults. The GSS sample data file has 2867 observations of 935 variables, but we are only interested in very few of these variables and you are using a smaller file.


```{r, read_gss_data, cache=TRUE}
gss <- read_csv(here::here("data", "smallgss2016.csv"), 
                na = c("", "Don't know",
                       "No answer", "Not applicable"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be creating 95% confidence intervals for population parameters. The variables we have are the following:

- hours and minutes spent on email weekly. The responses to these questions are recorded in the `emailhr` and `emailmin` variables. For example, if the response is 2.50 hours, this would be recorded as emailhr = 2 and emailmin = 30.
- `snapchat`, `instagrm`, `twitter`: whether respondents used these social media in 2016
- `sex`: Female - Male
- `degree`: highest education level attained


## Instagram and Snapchat, by sex

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Snapchat or Instagram users in 2016?

1. Create a  new variable, `snap_insta` that is *Yes* if the respondent reported using any of Snapchat (`snapchat`) or Instagram (`instagrm`), and *No* if not. If the recorded value was NA for both of these questions, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of Yes’s for `snap_insta` among those who answered the question, i.e. excluding NAs.
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct 95% CIs for men and women who used either Snapchat or Instagram
```{r, read_gss_data2, cache=TRUE}

#calculate proportion of Yes's for snap_insta
proportion_snap_insta <- gss %>%
  filter(snapchat %in% c("Yes","No","NA"),
         instagrm %in% c("Yes","No","NA")) %>%
  mutate(snap_insta=case_when(
    snapchat=="Yes" | instagrm=="Yes" ~ "Yes",
    snapchat=="NA" & instagrm=="NA" ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No")) %>% filter(snap_insta!="NA") %>% 
  specify(response=snap_insta,success="Yes") %>% 
  generate(reps=1000,type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="prop")

#calculate snap_insta ci
snap_insta_ci <- proportion_snap_insta %>% 
   get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type="percentile")

#visualize snap_insta ci
proportion_snap_insta %>% visualize(bins = 15) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = snap_insta_ci)

snap_insta_ci

```
## Twitter, by education level

Can we estimate the *population* proportion of Twitter users by education level in 2016?. 

There are 5 education levels in variable `degree` which, in ascneding order of years of education, are Lt high school, High School, Junior college, Bachelor, Graduate. 

1. Turn `degree` from a character variable into a factor variable. Make sure the order is the correct one and that levels are not sorted alphabetically which is what R by default does. 
1. Create a  new variable, `bachelor_graduate` that is *Yes* if the respondent has either a `Bachelor` or `Graduate` degree. As before, if the recorded value for either was NA, the value in your new variable should also be NA.
1. Calculate the proportion of `bachelor_graduate` who do (Yes) and who don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Using the CI formula for proportions, please construct two 95% CIs for `bachelor_graduate` vs whether they use (Yes) and don't (No) use twitter. 
1. Do these two Confidence Intervals overlap?

## Proportion of bachelor graduate:
```{r, twitter_proportion}

# Split degree into factor variables
twitter_gss <- gss %>% 
  mutate(degree=factor(degree,
                       levels = c(
                         "Lt high school",
                         "High School",
                         "Junior college",
                         "Bachelor",
                         "Graduate"),
                       ordered=TRUE))

# create bachelor_degree var
twitter_gss <- gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_degree=case_when(
    degree=="Bachelor" |degree=="Graduate" ~ "Yes",
    is.na(degree) ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No"
  ))

#create sample proportion
twitter_prop <- twitter_gss %>%
  filter(bachelor_degree=="Yes",twitter %in% c("Yes","No")) %>% 
  summarise(twitter_yes=mean(twitter=="Yes"),
            twitter_no=mean(twitter=="No"))
twitter_prop
```
## 95% Confidence interval for bachelor graduate who use Twitter:

```{r, twitter_yes}
# create bachelor_degree var
twitter_gss <- gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_degree=case_when(
    degree=="Bachelor" |degree=="Graduate" ~ "Yes",
    is.na(degree) ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No"
  ))

twitter_user_yes <- twitter_gss %>% 
  filter(bachelor_degree=="Yes",twitter %in% c("Yes","No")) %>%
  specify(response=twitter,success="Yes") %>% 
  generate(reps=1000,type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="prop")

#create confidence interval
twitter_user_yes_ci <- twitter_user_yes %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type="percentile")

#visualize twitter_user_yes ci
twitter_user_yes %>% visualize(bins = 15) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = twitter_user_yes_ci)

twitter_user_yes_ci
```
### 95% Confidence interval for bachelor graduate who do not use Twitter

```{r, twitter_no}
# create bachelor_degree var
twitter_gss <- gss %>% 
  mutate(bachelor_degree=case_when(
    degree=="Bachelor" |degree=="Graduate" ~ "Yes",
    is.na(degree) ~ "NA",
    TRUE ~ "No"
  ))

twitter_user_no <- twitter_gss %>% 
  filter(bachelor_degree=="Yes",twitter %in% c("Yes","No")) %>%
  specify(response=twitter,success="No") %>% 
  generate(reps=1000,type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="prop")

#create confidence interval
twitter_user_no_ci <- twitter_user_no %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type="percentile")

#visualize twitter_user_no ci
twitter_user_no %>% visualize(bins = 15) + 
  shade_confidence_interval(endpoints = twitter_user_no_ci)
twitter_user_no_ci
```

According to the graphs above, among individuals who have a 'bachelor' degree or higher, the proportion that use Twitter overlaps with the confidence interval for people who do not use Twitter. This occurs at the higher end of the two confidence intervals because people who do not use Twitter fall into the interval 73%-81%, and people who do use Twitter fall into the interval 19%-27%.

## Email usage

Can we estimate the *population* parameter on time spent on email weekly?

1. Create a new variable called `email` that combines `emailhr` and `emailmin` to reports the number of minutes the respondents spend on email weekly.
1. Visualise the distribution of this new variable. Find the mean and the median number of minutes respondents spend on email weekly. Is the mean or the median a better measure of the typical amoung of time Americans spend on email weekly? Why?
1. Using the `infer` package, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean amount of time Americans spend on email weekly. Interpret this interval in context of the data, reporting its endpoints in “humanized” units (e.g. instead of 108 minutes, report 1 hr and 8 minutes). If you get a result that seems a bit odd, discuss why you think this might be the case.
1. Would you expect a 99% confidence interval to be wider or narrower than the interval you calculated above? Explain your reasoning.

```{r, email_usage_skim}
email <- gss %>% 
  mutate(emailhr=as.numeric(emailhr),emailmin=as.numeric(emailmin))

email <- email %>%
  mutate(emailmin_total=emailhr*60+emailmin)
skim(email %>% select(emailmin_total))

```
The mean is 417 while the median is 120. Because of the data set and the number of outliers, we can assume that the median is the more accurate measure.


```{r, email_usage_ci}
email <- email %>% 
  specify(response=emailmin_total) %>% 
  generate(reps=1000,type="bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat="mean")

email_ci <- email %>%
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type="percentile") %>% 
  mutate(lower_ci_hrs=lower_ci%/%60,lower_ci_mins=lower_ci%%60,
         upper_ci_hrs=upper_ci%/%60,upper_ci_mins=upper_ci%%60) 

# visualize email_ci
email_ci

```

The lower confidence interval is 386.77 minutes (6 hours, 26.77 minutes), and the upper confidence interval is 446.87 minutes (7 hours,26.87 minutes). If we increase the confidence interval to 99%, we would project the range to be larger to make sure that the result would be in the range. As a result, the lower confidence interval would be smaller than 386 minutes and the higher confidence interval would be bigger than 446 minutes.


# Trump's Approval Margins

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

Confidence interval for the week 34 of 2020 is much wider than the confidence interval for the week 15 of the same year. Specifically, in week 15 of 2020 we have a confidence interval which ranges from -8.21 to -5.99. Number of polls conducted in this year was 35, and the standard deviation is roughly 3.24. On the other hand, for the week 34 we have fewer polls conducted (32). In addition standard deviation is larger and corresponds to 7.14, both things leading to a larger standard error and hence a larger confidence interval (-8.34 to -13.49). 

# Gapminder revisited

Recall the `gapminder` data frame from the gapminder package. That data frame contains just six columns from the larger [data in Gapminder World](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). In this part, you will join a few dataframes with more data than the 'gapminder' package. Specifically, you will look at data on 


- Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
- GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
- Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
- Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
- Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
- HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

You must use the `wbstats` package to download data from the World Bank. The relevant World Bank indicators are `SP.DYN.TFRT.IN`, `SE.PRM.NENR`, `NY.GDP.PCAP.KD`, and `SH.DYN.MORT`

```{r, get_data, cache=TRUE}

# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API

You have to join the 3 dataframes (life_expectancy, worldbank_data, and HIV) into one. You may need to tidy your data first and then perform [join operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html). Think about what type makes the most sense **and explain why you chose it**.

1. What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find faceting useful
1. What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? Generate a scatterplot with a smoothing line to report your results. You may find facetting by region useful
1. Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? Generate a bar chart (`geom_col()`), in descending order.
1. How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? In each region, find the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration.
1. Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate?


# Challenge 1: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

Let us revisit the [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf). There are well over 3 million entries of individual, de-identified patient data. Since this is a large file, I suggest you use `vroom` to load it and you keep `cache=TRUE` in the chunk options.


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# file contains 11 variables and 3.66m rows and is well over 380Mb. 
# It will take time to download

# URL link to CDC to download data
url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% # If vroom::vroom(url) doesn't work, use read_csv(url)
  clean_names()

  glimpse(clean_names)


```

It is necessary to format the data first and clean any incorrect, missing and unknown value

```{r}
  
  covid_data <- covid_data %>%
  mutate(icu_yn = case_when(
    icu_yn == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    icu_yn == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    icu_yn == "Other" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ icu_yn),
    
    death_yn = case_when(
    death_yn == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    death_yn == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    death_yn == "Other" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ death_yn),
    
    hosp_yn = case_when(
    hosp_yn == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    hosp_yn == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    hosp_yn == "Other" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ hosp_yn),
    
    race_and_ethnicity_combined = case_when(
    race_and_ethnicity_combined == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    race_and_ethnicity_combined == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    race_and_ethnicity_combined == "Other" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ race_and_ethnicity_combined),
    
    sex = case_when(
    sex == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    sex == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    sex == "Other" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ sex),
    
    age_group = case_when(
    age_group == "Unknown" ~ NA_character_,
    age_group == "Missing" ~ NA_character_,
    age_group == "Other" ~ NA_character_,
    TRUE ~ age_group),
    )


```


Now, we have to replace the unknown and missing values with NA

```{r}

      labels = c("Presence of comorbidities",

```


Given the data we have, I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("comorbidities_deaths.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(here::here ("ICU_deaths.png"))
```

It is possible to conclude that the presence of comorbidities and the fact of receive UCI treatment have a significant impact on the death rates by COVID-19 

Besides the graphs, make sure your code is easy to read and understand-- imagine if you revisit this six months from now. you should be able to follow what you were doing!


# Challenge 2: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The distribution of bikes hired are relatively flat in May and June in 2020 compared with precious years. This has something to do with the COVID-19 restrictions.

Now we are going to look at the monthly excess bike rentals and weekly excess bike rentals from 2015-2019. Below are the required replication of 2 figures.

##Replication of figures

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The first one looks at the excess monthly rentals, which is the difference between actual monthly rentals and the expected monthly rentals. And we use the average number to calculated the monthly rentals. The red areas stand for negative excess rentals, and the green areas stand for positive excess rentals.

```{r,tfl_absolute_monthly_changes,out.width="100%"}
#Monthly rental changes
#compute the actual rentals - using mean
m_avg_bike_act<-bike%>%
  filter(year>=2015)%>%
  group_by(year,month)%>%
  summarise(month_avg=mean(bikes_hired))

#compute the expected rentals - using mean
m_avg_bike<-bike%>%
  filter(year %in% c(2015:2019))%>% 
  group_by(month)%>% 
  summarise(month_avg_exp=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  left_join(y=m_avg_bike_act,join_by=month)%>%
  mutate(excess_month=month_avg-month_avg_exp)

#Replicate Figure1 - Graph for monthly changes
ggplot(m_avg_bike,aes(x=month,y=month_avg,group=1))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_line(aes(y=month_avg_exp,group=1),
            color="blue",
            size=1)+
  
  #color the monthly excess rentals each year
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=month_avg_exp,ymax=if_else(excess_month<0,month_avg,month_avg_exp)),
              fill=alpha("#CB454A",alpha=0.5))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=month_avg_exp,ymax=if_else(excess_month>0,month_avg,month_avg_exp)),
              fill=alpha("#7DCD85",alpha=0.5))+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  
  #Add titles and caption
  labs(title="Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle="Change from monthly average shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019",
       x=NULL,
       y="Bike rentals",
       caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store")+
  
  #Adjust the theme
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        aspect.ratio = 1,
        plot.title = element_text(size=10,face="bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=4),
        strip.text = element_text(size=4),
        axis.text= element_text(size=4),
        axis.title = element_text(size=6),
        axis.ticks= element_blank())+
  NULL
```


The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. And we use the average number for calculation as well. Besides, we add two grey-shaded rectangles, which correspond to the second and fourth quarters.

```{r,out.width="100%"}
#Weekly rental changes
#compute the actual rentals - using mean
w_avg_bike_act<-bike%>%
  filter(year>=2015)%>%
  group_by(year,week)%>%
  summarise(week_avg=mean(bikes_hired))

#compute the expected rentals - using mean
w_avg_bike<-bike%>%
  filter(year %in% c(2015:2019))%>% 
  group_by(week)%>% 
  summarise(week_avg_exp=mean(bikes_hired))%>%
  left_join(y=w_avg_bike_act,join_by=week)%>%
  mutate(excess_week_pct=week_avg/week_avg_exp-1)

#Replicate Graph for monthly changes
ggplot(w_avg_bike,aes(x=week,y=excess_week_pct,group=1))+
  
  #Add gray-shaded rectangles for Q2 & Q4
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=13,xmax=26,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),
            fill=alpha("#EDEDED",alpha=0.5),
            color="#EDEDED",
            show.legend = FALSE)+
  geom_rect(aes(xmin=39,xmax=53,ymin=-Inf,ymax=Inf),
            fill=alpha("#EDEDED",alpha=0.5),
            color="#EDEDED",
            show.legend = FALSE)+
  
  #plot %change of weekly average rentals
  geom_line(size=0.5,color="black")+
  
  #color the %weekly excess rentals
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=if_else(excess_week_pct<0,excess_week_pct,0)),
              fill=alpha("#CB454A",alpha=0.5))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=0,ymax=if_else(excess_week_pct>0,excess_week_pct,0)),
              fill=alpha("#7DCD85",alpha=0.5))+
  
  #Add rug bars at the bottom of each panel
  geom_rug(sides="b",
           aes(color=if_else(excess_week_pct>0,alpha("#CB454A",alpha=0.5),alpha("#7DCD85",alpha=0.5))),
           show.legend = FALSE)+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  
  #Add titles and caption
  labs(title="Weekly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle="% change from weekly averages \ncalculated between 2015-2019",
       x="week",
       y=NULL,
       caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store")+
  
  #Adjust the axis and the theme
  scale_y_continuous(labels =scales::percent)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(13,26,39,53),labels = c("13","26","39","53"))+
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        aspect.ratio = 1,
        plot.title = element_text(size=10,face="bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=4),
        strip.text = element_text(size=4),
        axis.ticks= element_blank(),
        axis.text= element_text(size=4),
        axis.title = element_text(size=6))+
  NULL

```

According to the figures above, we could see that both the monthly expected rentals and the weekly expected rentals are much higher than actual rentals earlier in 2020, yet situation reversed in May and June. The easing COVID-19 restrictions from May may lead to this reverse. 

Since the mean of bikes hired may be more affected by the outliers, especially in 2020 considering the pandemic's impacts, we re-estimate based on the median of bikes hired and try to see if there's any difference in the result.

##Re-estimations using median

Here's the result of absolute monthly changes from 2015-2020.

```{r,tfl_absolute_monthly_changes_using_median,out.width="100%"}

#Monthly rental changes
#compute the actual rentals - using median
m_avg_bike_act2<-bike%>%
  filter(year>=2015)%>%
  group_by(year,month)%>%
  summarise(month_avg=median(bikes_hired))

#compute the expected rentals - using median
m_avg_bike2<-bike%>%
  filter(year %in% c(2015:2019))%>%

  summarise(month_avg_exp=median(bikes_hired))%>%
  left_join(y=m_avg_bike_act2,join_by=month)%>%
  mutate(excess_month=month_avg-month_avg_exp)

#Replicate Figure1 - Graph for monthly changes
ggplot(m_avg_bike2,aes(x=month,y=month_avg,group=1))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_line(aes(y=month_avg_exp,group=1),
            color="blue",
            size=1)+
  
  #color the monthly excess rentals each year
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=month_avg_exp,ymax=if_else(excess_month<0,month_avg,month_avg_exp)),
              fill=alpha("#CB454A",alpha=0.5))+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=month_avg_exp,ymax=if_else(excess_month>0,month_avg,month_avg_exp)),
              fill=alpha("#7DCD85",alpha=0.5))+
  facet_wrap(~year)+
  
  #Add titles and caption
  labs(title="Monthly changes in TfL bike rentals",
       subtitle="Change from monthly median shown in blue \nand calculated between 2015-2019",
       x=NULL,
       y="Bike rentals",
       caption="Source: TfL, London Data Store")+
  
  #Adjust the theme
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour="#ECECEC"),
        aspect.ratio = 1,
        plot.title = element_text(size=10,face="bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),
        plot.caption = element_text(size=4),
        strip.text = element_text(size=4),
        axis.text= element_text(size=4),
        axis.title = element_text(size=6),
        axis.ticks= element_blank())+
  NULL
```

As you can see, although the actual monthly rentals in March and April in 2020 are still far below the expectation, the monthly excess rentals calculated in median are less than that calculated in mean. And this also suggests that the number of hired bikes came back to the normal level in July,2020, which is also consistent to the distribution of bikes hired per month.

Same conclusions could be driven in the weekly excess rentals.

```{r,out.width="100%"}

Here's the difference between the monthly expected rentals calculated in different ways. Generally, the difference between monthly average and monthly median is negative, which suggests a left-skewed distribution. What's more, the difference of actual monthly rentals fluctuates a lot in 2020, and the difference of expected monthly rentals would be more stable because of the 5-year window.

Again, similar conclusions could be found from the perspective of weekly rentals.

Overall, using the median might be a better way to calculate the expected rentals since it's more stable and hardly affected by the outliers.


# Deliverables

As usual, there is a lot of explanatory text, comments, etc. You do not need these, so delete them and produce a stand-alone document that you could share with someone. Knit the edited and completed R Markdown file as an HTML document (use the "Knit" button at the top of the script editor window) and upload it to Canvas.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
